# Tweetz


## After 13 years, the end has come. Twitter has disabled all third party applications including my inconsequential little application. ðŸ˜¥ It was fun while it lasted. Thanks to everyone who supported me over the years.

Tweetz is a Windows 10 desktop twitter client. It's minimal design mimics gadget style applications. I use it to monitor current events and announcements in the developer community.
